# Document Scanner using OpenCV



## Overview
This Python script provides functionality for scanning documents from an image file. It detects the document edges, applies perspective transformation to obtain a top-down view, and displays the scanned document.


## Features
- **Document Edge Detection**: Utilizes edge detection techniques to identify document boundaries.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Applies perspective transformation to correct for perspective distortion and obtain a top-down view of the document.
- **GUI Interface**: Includes a simple GUI interface built using Tkinter for selecting an image file and displaying the scanned document.
- **Flexibility**: The script is flexible and can handle various document sizes and orientations.

## Requirements
